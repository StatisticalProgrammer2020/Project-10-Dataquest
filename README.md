# DQ R-Project 10: Advertising an E-learning Platform
This is my tenth project in Dataquest towards my journey in R Programming. This project aims to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in. Specifically, we'll be using the dataquest survey datasets in order to determine which of the top countries should we advertise for this platform. In this project, the following concepts are used to achieve the given problem:
- Summary Statistics
- Frequency Distribution Tables

# Data source

The source of the dataset can be accessed here along with the information on the variables: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey/tree/master/clean-data
